# Security Audit Report

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive security audit of the Connex application, covering all implemented features and potential vulnerabilities.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ JWT-based authentication with secure token handling
- ✅ Password hashing using bcrypt with appropriate cost factor
- ✅ Role-based access control (RBAC) ready
- ✅ Secure session management
- ✅ Token expiration and refresh mechanisms

### 2. Input Validation & Sanitization
- ✅ Request validation using struct tags and custom validation
- ✅ SQL injection protection through parameterized queries (sqlx)
- ✅ Input sanitization for user-provided data
- ✅ Content-Type validation for API endpoints

### 3. Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection
- ✅ Redis-based rate limiting with configurable limits
- ✅ Per-IP rate limiting for general endpoints
- ✅ Stricter rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- ✅ Rate limit headers in responses
- ✅ Graceful degradation when Redis is unavailable

### 4. CORS & Security Headers
- ✅ Configurable CORS policy with secure defaults
- ✅ Security headers middleware
- ✅ Content Security Policy (CSP) ready
- ✅ XSS protection headers

### 5. Database Security
- ✅ Parameterized queries preventing SQL injection
- ✅ Connection pooling with limits
- ✅ Database connection encryption (SSL/TLS)
- ✅ Prepared statements usage

### 6. Caching Security
- ✅ Cache key sanitization using MD5 hashing
- ✅ Cache invalidation mechanisms
- ✅ No sensitive data in cache keys
- ✅ Cache bypass for authenticated endpoints

### 7. Monitoring & Observability
- ✅ Prometheus metrics with secure defaults
- ✅ OpenTelemetry tracing with configurable sampling
- ✅ Structured logging without sensitive data exposure
- ✅ Health check endpoints for monitoring

### 8. Error Handling
- ✅ Centralized error handling
- ✅ No sensitive information in error responses
- ✅ Consistent error response format
- ✅ Proper HTTP status codes

## Security Vulnerabilities Found & Fixed

### 1. Metrics Endpoint Exposure
**Issue**: Metrics endpoint `/metrics` was publicly accessible
**Fix**: Added authentication middleware for metrics endpoint in production
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 2. Trace Data Exposure
**Issue**: OpenTelemetry traces could contain sensitive data
**Fix**: Implemented trace sampling and sensitive data filtering
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 3. Rate Limiting Bypass
**Issue**: Rate limiting could be bypassed with certain headers
**Fix**: Improved IP detection logic considering proxies
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

### 4. Cache Poisoning
**Issue**: Cache keys could be manipulated
**Fix**: Implemented MD5 hashing for cache keys
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

## Security Recommendations

### 1. Production Deployment
- [ ] Use HTTPS/TLS in production
- [ ] Implement proper secrets management (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- [ ] Enable security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
- [ ] Configure proper CORS origins
- [ ] Use strong JWT secrets (32+ characters)
- [ ] Enable database SSL/TLS

### 2. Monitoring & Alerting
- [ ] Set up security monitoring for failed login attempts
- [ ] Monitor for unusual traffic patterns
- [ ] Alert on rate limit violations
- [ ] Monitor for SQL injection attempts
- [ ] Set up log aggregation and analysis

### 3. Additional Security Measures
- [ ] Implement API key authentication for external services
- [ ] Add request/response logging for audit trails
- [ ] Implement account lockout after failed attempts
- [ ] Add two-factor authentication (2FA)
- [ ] Implement password complexity requirements

### 4. Infrastructure Security
- [ ] Use container security scanning
- [ ] Implement network segmentation
- [ ] Regular security updates and patches
- [ ] Backup encryption
- [ ] Disaster recovery procedures

## Security Testing

### Automated Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for security functions
- [ ] Integration tests for authentication flows
- [ ] Penetration testing scripts
- [ ] Security linting (gosec, nancy)

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Authentication bypass attempts
- [ ] SQL injection testing
- [ ] XSS payload testing
- [ ] Rate limiting bypass attempts
- [ ] Authorization testing

## Compliance

### GDPR Compliance
- [ ] Data minimization
- [ ] Right to be forgotten
- [ ] Data portability
- [ ] Privacy by design

### SOC 2 Compliance
- [ ] Access controls
- [ ] Audit logging
- [ ] Change management
- [ ] Incident response

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Response Plan
1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring and alerting
2. **Assessment**: Impact analysis and severity classification
3. **Containment**: Immediate response to limit damage
4. **Eradication**: Root cause analysis and fix
5. **Recovery**: System restoration and verification
6. **Lessons Learned**: Documentation and process improvement
